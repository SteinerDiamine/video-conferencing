# Video Conferencing App

### About

Welcome to my video conferencing app! This app lets you attend meetings, hop on video calls, join seminars, and more. It's packed with features like recording your sessions and scheduling future calls or meetings — all in one place!

### Features

- **Join Meetings & Calls**: Whether it’s a quick video chat or a formal seminar, you're covered.
- **Schedule Your Sessions**: Set up meetings or calls in advance and get reminders.
- **Recording**: Record your sessions so you can go back and review them later.
- **Real-time Video & Audio**: Smooth, high-quality streaming so you don't miss a beat.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed with simplicity in mind, so you can focus on your meeting and not on figuring out the app.

### Tech Stuff

This app is fully built using Next.js, a powerful React-based framework that provides server-side rendering, API routes, and a seamless developer experience. Next.js allows for fast, scalable, and easy-to-maintain web applications, making it the perfect choice for building this video conferencing platform.

### How to Use It

1. **Schedule a Meeting**: Go to the scheduling section, pick a time, and invite your friends or colleagues.
2. **Join a Call**: Use the meeting link or ID to jump into any meeting or seminar.
3. **Record Sessions**: Hit record to save your meetings and check them out in the “Recordings” section later.
